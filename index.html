    <p>Mark Mulligan begin his career as a high school band director where he taught percussion. After doing this for
      several years, Mark developed an interest in coding and computer programming. Learning on his own in his spare
      time, he began creating small applications and projects. He was even able to create music specific websites that
      allowed his students more resources for learning. After several months of working on his own, Mark
      took the next step of attending a coding bootcamp.</p>
    <br>

    <P> At the SMU coding bootcamp, Mark continued to develope his skills both inside and outside of the classroom. He
      was to build upon his previous experience coding and learn more complex aspects of computer programming such as
      backend technologies and frameworks like React. Throughout this time, Mark's interest in programming continued
      to grow as he learned more and was able to create more complex projects.</P>

    <p>Currently, Mark is looking to change careers from teaching to becoming a software engenieer. While being a
      teacher has taught him many useful skills and has been an enjoyable part of his life, he is ready to take on this
      new challenge. Mark has always been creative, and working in software developement will allow him to use the
      creativity he had in music in a different field.</p>
